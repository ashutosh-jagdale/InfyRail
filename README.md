Admin Control Dashboard: Comprehensive dashboard for administrators to manage train schedules, bookings, and user data.
Integrated Payment Gateway: Secure and seamless payment process for ticket booking.
Real-time Booking: Ensures that seat availability and booking status are updated in real-time.
User Interfaces for Multiple Roles: Different interfaces for passengers, administrators, and support staff.
Tech Stack
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
Frontend: Angular
Database: MySQL
Other Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git, Maven
Application Architecture Overview
System Architecture
InfyRailMS implements a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, flexibility, and efficient management of different components:

Frontend Service(s): Built with Angular, focusing on reusable, modular UI components for a dynamic user experience.
Backend Service(s): Utilizes Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for RESTful API interactions and modular business logic processing.
Database(s): MySQL is chosen for its reliability and robustness, fitting well with the structured data requirements of railway management.
This structure leverages the strengths of microservices to enhance scalability and maintain development efficiency.

Application Structure
Client-Side: Built with Angular, utilizing Bootstrap for UI components and managing state with NgRx.
Server-Side: Uses Spring Boot running on Java to handle API requests, connect with MySQL, and manage server logic.
Database: MySQL for data storage with complex queries, schemas, and models designed to handle user, train, and booking data.
User Roles and Interfaces
Passengers: Interface for browsing train schedules and booking tickets.
Administrators: Interface to manage train schedules, handle bookings, and oversee system settings.
Support Staff: Interface to provide customer support and manage user inquiries.
Architecture Style
InfyRailMS adopts a microservices architecture style, focusing on modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

Key Characteristics:
Performance: Non-blocking I/O with Angular and Spring Boot ensures high throughput.
Scalability: Microservices design and MySQL’s capabilities enhance the system’s scalability.
Security: Robust security with JWT-based authentication and authorization.
Responsiveness: Angular provides fluid and interactive user interfaces.
Fault Tolerance: Redundancy and failover mechanisms minimize downtime and maintain service continuity.
Software Design Principles
Modularity:
Frontend: Reusable Angular components, utilizing Bootstrap for UI consistency.
Backend: Spring modules manage distinct functionalities like user authentication and data processing.
Separation of Concerns: Clear functional division enhances code maintainability and readability.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated building, testing, and deployment using Docker and GitHub workflows.
Iterative Development: Agile development with regular sprints and stakeholder feedback for continuous improvement.
Challenges Faced
Handling concurrent bookings where multiple users attempt to book the same seat simultaneously.
Ensuring secure logins and access control for users and administrators.
Integrating third-party payment gateways.
Solutions
Used a locking mechanism to manage concurrent bookings.
Implemented JWT for secure authentication.
Utilized secure, well-documented APIs provided by payment gateways.
Lessons Learned
Real-Time Data Handling: Techniques for managing real-time data interactions.
Agile Methodology: Importance of sprint planning, retrospectives, and testing for application development.
Security Practices: Implementation of security measures, including JWTs and HTTPS.
Improvements
